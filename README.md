### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights on global layoffs between March 2020 and March 2023. By analyzing various aspects of the layoff data, we can identify key trends in the global layoffs that took place between March 2020 and March 2023. Through this, we can gain an understanding of who was affected the most by these layoffs.
